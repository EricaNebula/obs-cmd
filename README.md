## Installation

### Binaries

You can download the latest pre-compiled binaries for your operating system from the [Releases](https://github.com/grigio/obs-cmd/releases/latest) page.

**Linux/macOS:**
```bash
# Download the appropriate binary for your system
curl -L https://github.com/grigio/obs-cmd/releases/latest/download/obs-cmd-linux-amd64 -o obs-cmd
chmod +x obs-cmd
sudo mv obs-cmd /usr/local/bin/
```

### From Source

Ensure you have [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) installed, then run the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/grigio/obs-cmd.git
cd obs-cmd
cargo install --path .
```

### Arch Linux

`obs-cmd` is available on the Arch User Repository (AUR). You can install it using an AUR helper like `yay`:

```bash
yay -S obs-cmd
```

## Usage

`obs-cmd` connects to the OBS WebSocket server. By default, it attempts to connect to `obsws://localhost:4455` with the password `secret`. You can configure the WebSocket settings in OBS under **Tools â†’ WebSocket Server Settings**.

To override the default connection settings, you can use the `--websocket` flag or set the `OBS_WEBSOCKET_URL` environment variable:

```bash
# Using the --websocket flag
obs-cmd --websocket obsws://<hostname>:<port>/<password> <command>

# Using an environment variable
export OBS_WEBSOCKET_URL=obsws://<hostname>:<port>/<password>
obs-cmd <command>
```

### Examples

```bash
# Switch to a scene named "Live"
obs-cmd scene switch Live

# Start recording
obs-cmd recording start

# Toggle the mute state of an audio source
obs-cmd audio toggle "Mic/Aux"

# Save a screenshot of a source
obs-cmd save-screenshot "Webcam" "png" "/path/to/screenshot.png"
```

For a full list of commands and options, run:
```bash
obs-cmd --help
```
